        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <p>Eyyy! I’m Terinique, a passionate web developer focused on creating clean, responsive, and user-friendly designs. I love building modern, robust and scalable web experiences that includes both frontend and backend technologies. I love working across disciplines to create real impact.</p>
        <p>When I'm not coding, I'm deeply passionate about a blend of creativity and strategy.
I have a growing interest in data—especially the psychology behind what grabs attention and drives engagement. Whether it's building a brand or crafting a campaign, I love experimenting with what makes messages stick.
On the creative side, cooking and baking is one of my favorite outlets. It’s where I unwind, get inventive, and bring people together—one dish at a time.
I'm also drawn to entrepreneurship—not just as a career path, but as a mindset. I enjoy spotting opportunities, solving problems, and creating things from the ground up.
At the heart of everything I do is creativity. Whether I'm designing, coding, planning, or brainstorming, I thrive on bringing new ideas to life and pushing boundaries just a bit further.</p>

        <p>Developer - Designing and building responsive websites for clients across industries.</p>
        <p>It was during this time that I devoloped my networking skills, aligning myself with industry professionals as I continued my skills development. I focused more on teamwork and collaboration skills as I identified myself as a tech Leader and broke out onto my own to take everything I've learned
            and cultivate an enjoyable user-eperience. I attended a bootcamp that introduced me to ML concepts (SQL, python, ect.) and Deep learning concepts. I've always had an analytical minds and thats why I spend my time working on projects to build my skillset and portfolio, this also gives me an opportunity to work with every aspect of an application
            giving me exposure to the hidden intricacies.

This experience helped me grow professionally but also on a personal level, and I'm truly grateful. I got exposure to Azure as a cloud interface, I went a little deeper in terms of SQL, and learned how to connect a database to an active application.</p>
